Full stack CRUD Application - Platform for Managing Students and Campuses
●	Due: June 14th, 2019 by 10:00AM
●	Points: 25
●	Submitting: GitHub URL to repository (front-end) and GitHub URL to repository (back-end)
●	Recommendation: Use create-react-app to bootstrap the front-end portion of the application and use express-generator to bootstrap the back-end portion of the application
○	You might also need to look into setting up a `proxy` in the package.json of the front-end or the `cors` npm module
●	If there is a time-crunch regarding setting up a back-end (database and routes), feel free to use dummy data on the front-end as a last resort
●	Group/Team Sizes: 2 to 3
Goal
Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This will cover all of the CRUD operations such as Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion. This will encompass models, querying a database with an ORM, designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state of the application with React-Redux, and much more. This will also involve having two individual repositories/applications (a separate server and a separate client), which encourages separation of concerns and modularity.
Assignment

○	[   ] see an informative message if no students are enrolled at that campus
○	[   ] navigate to any student’s single student view
○	[   ] delete the campus (and elegantly handle associated students)
